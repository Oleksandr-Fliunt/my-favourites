    <h2 class="center">Swimming</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Swimming is one of my favourite types of activities because it keeps me
      fit and at the same time lets my mind rest while I'm doing it. It's also
      one of the best full-body workouts for your health.

    <p>A few things I'm obsessed with about these movies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Plot... Unique and Entertaining!</li>
      <li>The Characters... Incredible Personalities!</li>
      <li>The Humour... Fantastic!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="center">LEGO</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Since I was kid and even till this day, Lego has been my hobby. No matter
      what Lego it is, the process of building a Lego feels really nice and
      relaxing for me.
